# 18F cloud.gov website

This repository contains the code and content for the [cloud.gov website](https://cloud.gov/).

cloud.gov is a Platform as a Service based on the Cloud Foundry project, which provides its own [Cloud Foundry documentation](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/).

## Contributing

Hugo uses Markdown to build the pages. Add your page to the section you want inside the content folder.

### Basic install

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) 2, if it's not on your system already. (Required for [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass)->[node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation).)
1. Install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

### Running the site locally

1. Run `npm install` to download all the dependencies.
1. Run `npm start` and browse to [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313).

### Process tips for cloud.gov team members

We usually use branches to write updates. After you merge a PR, click GitHub's button to delete that branch. (We don't need it anymore.)

### Links

To link to another page within cg-site, use `relref` to create [relative links](https://gohugo.io/extras/crossreferences/). Examples:

* `[Example text]({{< relref "directory/filename.md" >}})`
* `[What is cloud.gov?]({{< relref "overview/overview/what-is-cloudgov.md" >}})`
* `[Sharing secret keys]({{< relref "docs/ops/secrets.md#sharing-secret-keys" >}})`

### Redirects

If you delete or rename a page, make a redirect to avoid breaking links from other sites: [make an alias](https://gohugo.io/extras/aliases/) (use the "YAML frontmatter" style).

### Images

If you want to include an image in a page on the site, put it in `/static/img/`. Images there will show up at `https://cloud.gov/img/example.png`.

### Search

Our search feature is powered by [DigitalGov Search](http://search.digitalgov.gov/), which has a [Help Manual](http://search.digitalgov.gov/manual/index.html) with documentation about configuring it. [DigitalGov Search for Power Users](http://search.digitalgov.gov/blog/power-users-recap.html) is also useful.

We use [its default Bing indexing](http://search.digitalgov.gov/manual/content-overview.html), so our search may show outdated results if Bing hasn't recently reindexed our docs site.

### Style development

This site uses a shared cloud.gov style, [cg-style](https://github.com/18F/cg-style). This means any styling code has to be developed in *cg-style*.

1. Download or clone the *cg-style* repository, `git clone git@github.com:18F/cg-style.git`
2. Run the watching build task in the *cg-style* repository: `npm run watch`
3. Run `npm install` in the *cg-site* repository.
4. Run `npm link` in *cg-site*.
5. Run the watching build task in *cg-site* repository: `npm run watch`
6. Edit code in the *cg-style* directory and they will propagate down to *cg-site*

## Acknowledgment

The theme for the site has been "forked" from the [Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/overview/introduction/).
