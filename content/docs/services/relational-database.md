If your application uses relational databases for storage, you can use the AWS RDS service to create a database instance.

### Storage pricing:

- Shared instance: Free
- Simple instance: $0.138 per GB per month
- Redundant instance: $0.276 per GB per month

## Options

Name | Required | Description | Default
--- | --- | --- | ---
`storage` |  | Number of GB available to the database instance | 10

## Create an instance

To create a service instance run the following command:

```bash
cf create-service aws-rds medium-psql my-db-service
```

If you want to specify the storage available to the instance:

```bash
cf create-service aws-rds medium-psql my-db-service -c '{"storage": 50}'
```

### Bind to an application

`cf bind-service` will provide a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable for your app, which is then picked up by the `restage`. Note that for a Rails app, `bind-service` will [overwrite your `database.yml`](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/ruby/ruby-service-bindings.html#rails-applications-have-autoconfigured-database-yml). The full documentation for managing service instances is [here](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/managing-services.html).

The contents of the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable contain the credentials to access your database. Treat the contents of this and all other environment variables as sensitive.

## Access the data in the database

There are currently two ways to access the database.

1. [The `cg-migrate-db` plugin](#cg-migrate-db-plugin). It is a self contained
executable which will interactively assist with accessing the data in the
database. It supports accessing data from different types of databases.
1. [Manually accessing the database](#manually-access-a-database). This way
requires manually downloading the tool(s) needed to access the database. The
only type of database supported via this method is PostgreSQL.

### cg-migrate-db plugin
The easiest way to access the data in your database is via the `cg-migrate-db`
plugin.

Please check out the [repository](https://github.com/18F/cg-migrate-db)
for instructions on how to install the plugin, backup data, import data,
download a local copy of the data, and upload a local copy of the data.

It also includes a [how-to](https://github.com/18F/cg-migrate-db#1-migrating-from-ew-to-govcloud-in-4-steps)
for migrating data from one environment to another. (e.g. from East-West to
GovCloud)

### Manually access a database

The instructions below are for PostgreSQL, but should be similar for MySQL or others.

{{% govcloud %}}
#### Using cf ssh

To access a service database, use the [cf ssh]({{< relref "docs/getting-started/one-off-tasks.md#cf-ssh" >}}) CLI command to login to an instance that is bound to the service and download the `psql` binary to that instance:

```sh
cf ssh APP_NAME
curl https://s3.amazonaws.com/18f-cf-cli/psql-9.4.4-ubuntu-14.04.tar.gz | tar xvz
./psql/bin/psql $DATABASE_URL
```

You should now have an open `psql` terminal connected to the service database.

You can also use the [cf-service-connect plugin](https://github.com/18F/cf-service-connect#readme) for a shortcut way to do this.

{{% /govcloud %}}

### Export

#### Create backup

{{% govcloud %}}
#### Using cf ssh

First, connect to an instance:

```sh
$ cf ssh {app name}
```

Next, install the Postgresql tools:

```sh
$ curl https://s3.amazonaws.com/18f-cf-cli/psql-9.4.4-ubuntu-14.04.tar.gz > psql.tgz
$ tar xzvf psql.tgz
```

Now you can create the export file:

```sh
$ psql/bin/pg_dump --format=custom $DATABASE_URL > backup.pg
```
{{% /govcloud %}}

### Download

{{% govcloud %}}
> [Documentation for using scp and sftp](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/ssh-apps.html#other-ssh-access)

On your local host:

Get your app's GUID:

```sh
$ cf app {app name} --guid
```

Obtain a one-time authorization code:

```sh
$ cf ssh-code
```

Run `sftp` or `scp` to transfer files to/from an application instance.  You must specify port 2222 and supply the app GUID and instance number.  Use the one-time authorization from above as the password.  The username format is `cf:GUID/INSTANCE`.

For example, to connect to instance 0 of the application with GUID 0745e60b-c7f3-49a7-a6c2-878516a34796:

```
$ sftp -P 2222 cf:0745e60b-c7f3-49a7-a6c2-878516a34796/0@ssh.fr.cloud.gov
cf:0745e60b-c7f3-49a7-a6c2-878516a34796/0@ssh.fr.cloud.gov's password: ******
Connected to ssh.fr.cloud.gov.
sftp> get backup.pg
sftp> quit
```
{{% /govcloud %}}

### Restore to local database

Load the dump into your local database using the [pg_restore](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-pgrestore.html) tool. If objects exist in a
local copy of the database already, you might run into inconsistencies when doing a
`pg_restore`. This Pg_restore invocation does not drop all of the objects in the database when loading the
dump.

```sh
$ pg_restore --clean --no-owner --no-acl --dbname={database name} backup.pg
```
