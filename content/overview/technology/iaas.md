## The IaaS underlying cloud.gov

cloud.gov runs on top of Infrastructure as a Service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) in the [AWS GovCloud region](https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/), which has a [FedRAMP JAB P-ATO at the High impact level](https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/index.html#/product/aws-govcloud-high). GovCloud also offers support for other formal compliance needs such as [ITAR compliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Traffic_in_Arms_Regulations).

## Other IaaS vendors we can support

cloud.gov is a Platform as a Service (PaaS), which offers an additional level of services and functions beyond the basics offered by an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provider. We built cloud.gov based on the [Cloud Foundry open source project](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/), which was designed to be compatible with multiple IaaS providers. For that reason, it would be possible to provide cloud.gov services using Google Compute Engine, Microsoft Azure, or any public, commercial, or private OpenStack instance in the future.

## If youâ€™re an IaaS vendor interested in offering your solution to cloud.gov users

We recommend examining the [mega-ci project](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/mega-ci) and the [BOSH CPI documentation](https://bosh.io/docs/cpi-api-v1.html). Provide a similar option which makes it easy to continuously deploy Cloud Foundry components on their cloud. This will enable cloud.gov (or any other PaaS based on Cloud Foundry) to offer alternative API endpoints corresponding to different IaaS providers with little effort. cloud.gov will deploy on new IaaS providers and expose those as new API endpoints as warranted by agency demand.
